#summary How to import data from external source.

= Introduction =

When you create a new project (ex. myproject), you should create a file *myproject-connector.R* and add there a function *connector.importItemsData(project.path)* that gets the external data into a R dataframe with the following colnames:

 * KEY1
 * KEY2
 * ..
 * KEYN
 * PERIOD
 * VALUE1
 * VALUE2
 * ..
 * VALUEN

Notes:
 * It means you should put all time series into a single data frame.
 * "the primary key": there cannot be two rows with the same values of KEY1,KEY2,...,KEYN,PERIOD

Next step is to send teh new dataframe to one of the default functions for importing data provided by the engine:

 * ImportItemsDataFromDB
 * ImportItemsDataFromCSV

= KEYS =

The list of values of KEY1,KEY2,...,KEYN identifies an *item* of the project

= PERIOD=

Period is a string with two numbers separated by "," Usually the first number is the year and second one the month or the semester or the quarter ... For instance
 * 2001,1
 * 2001,2
 * 2002,1
 * 2002,2
 * ...
   
= VALUES =

For the same *item* and the same *period* you could have one or more time series (for instance the sales of your company and sales of competitors).
