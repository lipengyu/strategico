#summary How to import data from external source.

= Introduction =

When you create a new project (ex. myproject), you should create a file *myproject-connector.R* and add there a function *connector.importItemsData(project.path)* that gets external dato to a R dataframe with colnames like th following

 * KEY1
 * KEY2
 * ..
 * KEYN
 * PERIOD
 * VALUE1
 * VALUE2
 * ..
 * VALUEN

Notes:
 * It means you should put all time series into a single data frame.
 * "the primary key": there cannot be two rows with the same values of KEY1,KEY2,...,KEYN,PERIOD

Next step is to send teh new dataframe to one of the default functions for importing data provided by the engine:

 * ImportItemsDataFromDB
 * ImportItemsDataFromCSV

= KEYS =

The n-pla of values of KEY1,KEY2,...,KEYN identifies an *item* of the project

= PERIOD=

Period is a string with two numbers separated by "," Usually the first number is the year and second one the month or the semester or the quarter ... For instance
 2001,1
 2001,2
 2002,1
 2002,2
 ...
   
= VALUES =

For the same item and the same period you could have one or more data (for instance sales of your company and sales of competitors). The engine can manage *missing data*
