#summary Quick start on strategico OnlineService

= Setup =

I suppose you are installing the OnLine service on your PC Linux
 
You have to install a web server with php support. For linux (Debian and Ubuntu), for instance you simply run 

{{{
  sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork libapache2-mod-php5
}}}

The document root is the directory that corresponds to the url http://localhost
For Linux it is /var/www

You have to set the right paths in the file "strategico.config" (http://code.google.com/p/strategico/source/browse/trunk/strategico.config)

{{{
  projects.home="/var/www/strategico/projects",
  projects.url="http://localhost/strategico/projects",
}}}

In your document root, you should have at least the following directories and files (taken by strategico sources)

{{{
   strategico/projects/web-ltp
   strategico/projects/web-ltp/project.config
   strategico/ws/ws.html
   strategico/ws/ws.php
 }}}

Change in ws.php the path of strategico sources (by default /apps/strategico)

Be sure that the folder projects/web-ltp/1200 will be WRITABLE by the user that runs Apache. You can do

{{{
  cd /var/www/strategico
  mkdir projects/web-ltp/1200
  sudo chmod 777 projects/web-ltp/1200
}}}
